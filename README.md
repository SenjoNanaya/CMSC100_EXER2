To create a Github page you need to first:

A. Set your repository to public

B. Ensure that your index.html file and its subsequent requirements are at the root level of your repository

Next you go to your repository's settings tab -> Go to Pages around the Code and Automation section

Then click Deploy from a branch, preferably select your master or main branch that is most up to date

Wait for Github to give you your site's link

Tada! It should be done and viewable now.

My main takeaway from this exercise is that you can in fact do a lot with just HTML + CSS given some inspiration. Also media queries are fairly important in the grand scheme of things (I still have not tested it for mobile so I will see). Variables also helped me a lot in theming the website.
Additionally by having inspiration I learned a lot about gradients, I used them to make the checkbox pattern that Nier UI is known for.
Also the addition of having to check the site with https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file made me a lot more mindful with my end product in terms of how I wrote the HTML.
